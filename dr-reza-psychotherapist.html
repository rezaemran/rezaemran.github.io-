    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am Dr. Reza, a clinical psychologist with a passion for helping individuals struggling with addiction and mental health challenges. With a background in clinical psychology and an M.Sc. in the field, I bring a blend of professional experience, academic expertise, and empathy to my practice. Currently, I work as a psychotherapist and a school counselor, where I provide guidance and support to individuals across various age groups, with a particular focus on addiction, cognitive training, and behavioral therapy.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have developed a specialized application called "Neuro Rehab," featuring cognitive training games that help individuals with addiction improve their working memory and attention control. Additionally, I have translated significant psychological texts, such as "Psychoanalysis and Faith," deepening my understanding of psychoanalysis and therapeutic faith.
